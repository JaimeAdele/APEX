Although `matplotlib` is quite popular, the plots that it creates aren't particularly attractive without a lot of additional coding. \n",

        "`seaborn` to the rescue! `seaborn` uses `matplotlib` functions behind the scenes; in other words, it does the hard work for you, allowing users to much more easily and simply create attractive plots. To learn more about the types of plots that `seaborn` can create, we encourage checking out the [tutorial](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) and [example gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).  \n",
